# Binary Search

This repo implements the binary search algorithm, but with an interesting twist.
I have defined a class that inherits from a ```list```, then implements the binary search. During initialisation, this 
list expects two parameters : the length of the list and the difference between consecutive values. 

NOTE: Only numeric types are supported.

Please, take a look at the source [code](binary_search_src/binary_search.py).

## Why am I doing this?

These labs are part of the Andela boot-camp set of programming assignments, which am currently participating in.

Feel free to comment on the code or ask any questions about the boot-camp.
